# Rumble Plate Dice Roller
A switch adapted device to roll the dice for any game night!

This switch activated dice roller utilizes a hobby motor, battery holder, Omron switch, and 3.5mm jack along with a couple 3d printed parts and a clear plastic cup to make any dice game more accessible. This device is a new development of the Dice Spinner that features faster dice rolling and variations in allowable cup size.

The Rumble Plate Dice Roller allows for approximately 10oz to 22oz clear plastic cups. Following the assembly guide, the components can be wired and mounted, then the dice roller is all ready to use! It is an easy toy to make that allows people to roll the dice in an alternative way.

## Usage

An AT switch can be plugged into the 3.5mm jack on the side of the device to be used for activation. Alternatively, the on-device switch can be used for activation. The on-device button would be meant more for others playing around the table who are able to reach over and wrap their hands around the base to push the button. With the additional print of the vertical push base, the on-device button can be used to turn the device itself into the activation button such that anyone around the table can push on to top of  the clear cup to roll the dice. This on-device button can be used in tandem with the corded AT switch.
